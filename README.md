# Backend for Raptor-Trails

This is the code for the backend to raptor trails. It can access our database and perform basic CRUD-Operations on it. 

## Important notice
This is not the main project and has no frontend to see this visit our repository at [Github](https://github.com/Raptor-Trails/raptor-fe). Here is the [link](www.raptor-trails.com) to our website.

The hosting is done via Heroku. You can find and access the API [here](https://raptor-be.herokuapp.com/)

The backend includes several functions: 

## Test if server is working correclty via welcome "https://raptor-be.herokuapp.com/welcome"

## Get all Trails via "https://raptor-be.herokuapp.com/alltrails"

## Write trails via "https://raptor-be.herokuapp.com/addtrail"
Just make a post request and pass the json string of the mongoDB element.

# Testing
In the next few days i will implement unit tests and publish them here to demonstrate the functionality
